# Infosys Ltd – Three Statement Financial Analysis (FY2024)

### Overview
This project was designed and developed using **AI-assisted analysis**.

I created a **custom prompt** that automates the full *Three-Statement Financial Analysis* process —
including ratio computation, chart visualization, PowerPoint presentation, Excel model, and README generation.

The prompt was built and refined by me to replicate an **end-to-end analyst workflow using AI tools**.
All analysis is based on **public financial data from Infosys Limited (FY2024 9M)**
